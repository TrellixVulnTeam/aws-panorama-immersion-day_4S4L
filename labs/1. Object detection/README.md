# Lab 1. Object detection

> **Warning:** Make sure you have performed the steps described in the Prerequisites section before beginning this lab.


## Overview

This Lab will walk you through step-by-step instructions on how to build AWS Panorama application, starting with "Hello World" application, then Video pass-through application, and finally People counter application. By completing this Lab, you will learn 1) how to create necessary components of Panorama application with panorama-cli command and text editor, 2) how to use panoramasdk module APIs, 3) how to run the application on notebooks or your local PC environment with Test Utility, and 4) how to deploy applications to real Panorama appliance devices.

**Test Utility** is a simulation environment for application developers. While it doesn't provide full compatibility with real hardware, it helps you develop Panorama application without real hardware, with quick development iteration time. For more details about the Test Utility, please refer to [this page](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-panorama-samples/blob/main/docs/AboutTestUtility.md).

**panorama-cli** is a command-line utility to help Panorama application developers construct necessary components such as code node, model node, camera node, node packages, container image for code, and node graph structure. It also helps uploading packages to AWS Cloud before deploying application to the device. For more details about panorama-cli, please refer to [this page](https://github.com/aws/aws-panorama-cli).

## How to open and run notebook

This Lab uses SageMaker Notebook environment.
